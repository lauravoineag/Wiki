## Training plan

#### 1. Language over frameworks 

`Focus on learning fundamentals:`
`Learn language - C#, patterns, HTTP, REST first as these skills are transferrable. A lot of principles that apply in one language are common across others. OOP/ design patterns apply across multiple languages.`

**Learn Now**

- [ ] 15.Debugging
- [ ] 16.Async/await
- [ ] 17.LINQ
- [ ] 18.Exception Handling

#### 2. Defer frameworks for as long as possible
` - Defer learning about specific frameworks and libraries as long as possible, with ASP.NET (helps Mediator) being the exception.`
`- They change frequently  Things like WCF, WPF,React you will probably never need to know. Invest time on learning about fundamentals and put off learning about a new framework or tool until you need to.`
`- Languages change very slowly in comparison to frameworks (C# is a language and React is a framework)`
`- Frameworks and Third party Libraries allows you to structure/arhitect your code e.g. "How to write controllers" `
