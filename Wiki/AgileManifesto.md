# **Agile Manifesto**

### Values
___
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

`Competent people should drive the development process and not tools.`

`Allow people to take ownership and to contribute with their unique value (e.g their energy,innovation, ability to solve problems) to the software. Teamwork and communication becomes strong as people work together.`

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

`Build basic software (key skeleton software that is working) and get client feedback quickly rather than writing a book about every little detail and deliver it in a year.`

`The value comes from the quick software feedback (not documentation feedback) received from the client by USING this skeleton software. Build it to use it! 
The client, only after using the software, finds out what they need and then further development should be carried out based on their input.` 

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

`The client's review is built into the process and the client gets to see the product at the end of every sprint as opposed to the "waterfall process" where the client was only involved at the beggining and at end of the process.`
`The client then can steer the project by proving input to the developer.This increases client satisfaction by handling change effectively.`

- Responding to change over following a plan

`Start with the direction you want to move into and then proceed to see new events unfolding and incorporate them into ongoing work. New events are not to be seen as obstacles but instead as opportunities to provide additional value.`
`Not only to respond to change but to  welcome change (add, remove, reprioritize or even chuck away the whole product backlog) and shorten sprints (1 week -continuous integration) to accomodate change`

### Principles
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

`Create a gameplan and timeline and then get a team aligned to the top priority is the best way of achieving the goal`
`Constructive conflict is used toward a shared goal. Start working on items in priority order`

`What is the most important feature/item on the list? Create the minimal most important feature and go back to client for feedback.`

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

`Changes must be seen as a possibility and not as another way to delay and overcomplicate the project.`
`It doesn't matter how far along developers are in their process the cost/risk is still low to client as per constant feedback cycle.`

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

`Get requirements > prioritise requirements > deliver in priority order as soon as you can`
`Work towards several releases a day for software. By receiving constant feedback the risk is low for the customer not to use the software.) `

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

`By putting them together on a daily basis they get used to each other and they develop a common understanding of the goal of the project. Through Standups, Kick offs, retros developers have access to PMs and BAs`

- Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

`Eliminate micromanagement, trust the team to self-organise and empower the motivated team members in their solutions.`

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

`Enhance communication with people and minimise writing documentation in their absence`

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
`Working software is Released software. You measure progress when you deliver software.Don't fuss over items in QA.`
`It doesn't matter how many working hours you've invested in your project, how many bugs you managed to fix, or how many lines of code your team has written.If the result of your work is not the way your customer expects it to be, you are in trouble`

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

`Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, the users ,developers should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.`

`Pressure slips,bad habbits, shortcuts, non-pairing, non-mobbing makes the code unsustainable because people feel under pressure to deliver software quickly. They should not feel against the clock and they should not feel like they have to drop other things. It's about doing the right thing all the time! Coders shouldn't sacrifice code quality if they feel under pressure instead need to find a pace that would work for them even if it means delivering the product later than expected. People can use the Honesty Agile principle - if people are not going to hit the target what is going to happen?`


, your goal is to avoid overburden and optimize the way you work so you can frequently deliver to the market and respond to change without requiring personal heroics from your team.`

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
