#Training plan

### Goals :

> Short term goals
> Long term goals

####To Learn :


***Now***

Focus on learning fundamentals (language - C#, patterns, HTTP, REST) first. Skills that are transferrable. A lot of the principles that apply in one language are common to others. OOP / design patterns apply across many languages for example.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns

>   1. Learning to Learn
>   2. How to google and read documentation
>   3. Learn to be comfortable with Reading ~& Reusing Code~
>   5. Good priciples in place:OOP basic principles, CRUD, SOLID, RESTFUL

>   7. Valued types vs Reference types. Issues understanding what in memory/call stack.Why we need both of them? When to use which one? Pass by value and pass by reference. Using a reference like a value or vice versa
>   8. Lamda expressions,
>   9. JSON
>   11.  Naming of methods, classes, and variables, the use of comments, project files structure, the use & structure of tests

>   11. Receive regular feedback and constructive criticism
>   12. How to use a GIT repo effectively
>   13. C# Basics for Beginners
>   14. C# Intermediate: OOP

>   15. What is the difference between String and StringBuilder? (After that) What is immutable types?
>   16. Refactoring
>   17. Misunderstanding default values for uninitialized variables
>   18. Base API
>   19. Learn Design Patterns - What are the possible solution that people use for solving generalized problems.
>   20. Problem solving
>   22. Concepts put together create issues in understanding
>   23. What is nullable types? How they work and why we need them?

Moved from "A little later"

>   1. TDD
>   2. Debugging
>   8. Async/await
>   9. LINQ
>   17. Exception Handling

***A little later***

Defer learning about specific frameworks and libraries as long as possible, with ASP.NET as one exception as it's what we use on BrightSafe. Things like WCF, WPF you will probably never need to know so don't waste time on them. I do the same. I invest time on learning about fundamentals and put off learning about a new framework or tool until I need to.

**Messy Notes**

4. SDLC Software Development Life Cycle
`Requirement gathering and analysis`
`Feasibility study`
`Design`
`Implementation and Coding`
`Testing,Deployment,Maintenance`
`basic architectural ideas like layers`

11. Naming of methods, classes, and variables, the use of comments, project files structure, the use & structure of tests
`Possible solutions: Api,Projects on GitHubRead answers/questions on StackOverflow, Code challenge websites such as codewars.com, which show the answers to challenges`

13. C# Basics for Beginners
`Data structures: (learn to know the difference and when to use each data structure)`
`Eg collection, tree, stack, queue, hash tables, linked lists, basic graph representation (adjacency matrix, vertices, nodes)`
`In depth Properties and Fields`

14. C# Intermediate:OOP
`Classes, Interfaces and Object-oriented`
`Objects/instances of objects & interfaces being passed in as parameters in other methods`
`Containership, Abstract classes, Virtual functions, Polymorphism, Static and Runtime Binding, Tatic Base, Override, Overload, Inheritance`
`Interface vs. Abstract class`
`Inheritance vs. polymorphism`
`Class vs. instance variables`
`Access modifiers, property visibility control`

**Latereer Notes**
1. C# Advanced
`Programming paradigms: sync vs. async, functional vs. OOP.`
`OS: process, thread, multi-thread, deadlocks, threadsafe.`
`Networking: HTTP, client-server, distributed architecture.`

2. NET eco-system
`Basic concepts:`
`NET Framework Class Library … know the major namespaces, what they’re there for, etc`
`Frameworks: ASP.NET, .NET Core.`
`Runtimes:NET Framework Runtime, the compiler, CLR, CoreCLR`
`Difference between managed vs. unmanaged code`
`AppDomain vs. Process`
`Package, namespace, assembly (DLL), configuration (.config files)`
`Garbage collection`

3.  Algorithms:
`Learing the efficiency of the implementation, what algorithm or family of algorithms to use for each problem: sort, search, recursion, dynamic programming, big-O notation analysis`
