#Training plan

### Language over frameworks
Focus on learning fundamentals: 
Learn language - C#, patterns, HTTP, REST first qas these skills are transferrable. A lot of the principles that apply in one language are common across others. OOP / design patterns apply across multiple languages.

***Now***

Top 12:
>   1. C# Basics for Beginners 
>   2. C# Intermediate: OOP
>   3. Good priciples in place:OOP basic principles, CRUD, SOLID, RESTFUL
>   4. Naming of methods, classes, and variables, the use of comments, project files structure, the use & structure of tests 
>   5. How to use a GIT repo effectively
>   6. Base API 
>   7. Valued types vs Reference types. Issues understanding what in memory/call stack.Why we need both of them? When to use which one? Pass by value and pass by reference. Using a reference like a value or vice versa
>   8. Problem solving
>   9. Work on concepts that are put together to create further understanding
>   10. What is nullable types? How they work and why we need them?
>   11. HTTP Requests (request, headers, status codes )
>   12. Learn Design Patterns - What are the possible solution that people use for solving generalized problems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns

***A little later***

- Defer learning about specific frameworks and libraries as long as possible, with ASP.NET (helps Mediator) being the exception.
- They change frequently  Things like WCF, WPF,React you will probably never need to know. Invest time on learning about fundamentals and put off learning about a new framework or tool until you need to.
- Languages change very slowly in comparison to frameworks (C# is a language and React is a framework)
- Frameworks and Third party Libraries allows you to structure/arhitect your code e.g. "How to write controllers"

`Requirement gathering and analysis`
`Feasibility study`
`Design`
`Implementation and Coding`
`Testing,Deployment,Maintenance`
`basic architectural ideas like layers`

4. Naming of methods, classes, and variables, the use of comments, project files structure, the use & structure of tests 
`Possible solutions: Api,Projects on GitHubRead answers/questions on StackOverflow, Code challenge websites such as codewars.com, which show the answers to challenges`

1. C# Basics for Beginners 
`Data structures: (learn to know the difference and when to use each data structure)`
`Eg collection, tree, stack, queue, hash tables, linked lists, basic graph representation (adjacency matrix, vertices, nodes)`
`In depth Properties and Fields`

2. C# Intermediate:OOP 
`Classes, Interfaces and Object-oriented`
`Objects/instances of objects & interfaces being passed in as parameters in other methods`
`Containership, Abstract classes, Virtual functions, Polymorphism, Static and Runtime Binding, Tatic Base, Override, Overload, Inheritance`
`Interface vs. Abstract class`
`Inheritance vs. polymorphism`
`Class vs. instance variables`
`Access modifiers, property visibility control`

**Latereer Notes**
1. C# Advanced 
`Programming paradigms: sync vs. async, functional vs. OOP.`
`OS: process, thread, multi-thread, deadlocks, threadsafe.`
`Networking: HTTP, client-server, distributed architecture.`

2. NET eco-system
`Basic concepts:`
`NET Framework Class Library … know the major namespaces, what they’re there for, etc`
`Frameworks: ASP.NET, WF, WPF, WCF, UWP, .NET Core.`
